    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat your oil in a large frying pan or saucepan and add the chicken and
        bacon. Cook for about 5-10 minutes until just starting to turn brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the vegetables and cook for a further 5 minutes until they start
        to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour and thyme and stir through everything, cook for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the stock and milk to the vegetable and flour mix,
        stirring until the sauce is smooth. Leave to bubble away and thicken for
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon into a pie dish and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes if you
        have time.
      </li>
      <li>Smooth the pastry over the top of the filling.</li>
      <li>
        Decorate the pie with cut out shapes if you feel that way inclined and
        brush with the beaten egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are ready to bake the pie, preheat the oven to 220C and bake
        for about 30 minutes until the filling is hot throughout and the pastry
        is crisp and golden.
