    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1.4kg potatoes</li>
      <li>75g bacon, roughly diced</li>
      <li>1 large clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>3 large spring onions</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup plain flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups grated cheddar (200g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180C</li>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes and use a sharp knife to slice them very thinly (no
        more than 3-4mm thick). Place them in a large saucepan of water, and
        bring to the boil. Boil for 2 minutes, remove from heat and drain. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>Combine the cream and milk in a small jug and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Add the oil and bacon to the same pan and saute until just starting to
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onions and garlic and saute for a minute to soften a little
        before adding the butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the butter has melted add the flour. Stir well and cook for 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly drizzle in the stock while continuing to stir until the flour is
        totally dissolved into it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat down to low-medium, slowly add the cream and milk while
        whisking. Immediately add the thyme, salt and pepper. Keep stirring
        until it starts to thicken and bubble a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place about ⅓ cup of sauce in the base of a casserole dish and spread
        around.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add layers, ⅓ of each in this order: potatoes, sauce, cheese (so you
        finish with cheese)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 45-50 minutes until bubbling and just starting to turn golden
        on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want it a little browner on top, place it under an overhead grill
        / broiler for 2-3 minutes. No longer as the heat may cause the sauce to
        curdle.
      </li>
    </ol>
